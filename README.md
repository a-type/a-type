### Grant Forrest

I write elegant code to power innovative user experiences. My focus is React, complemented by TypeScript, GraphQL, and graph databases.

#### What I'm interested in these days

Graphs are still on my radar. I'm also curious about truly peer-to-peer web technologies, like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [OrbitDb](https://orbitdb.org/), [GUN](https://gun.eco/), and others. I've done a small bit of exploration in the form of a sandbox repo I named [cnxn](https://github.com/a-type/cnxn).

I'm also just interested in solving some hard problems which haven't been solved before.

#### Things I've done recently

##### ‚òÅ Clouds [Live demo](https://grantforrest.dev/demos/clouds)

I love clouds, so I created some using procedural generation and WebGL. They're all dynamically constructed right in your browser. That's where the image you see above comes from!

##### ‚å® Accessibility

After trying to implement a nested tree view in React, I was surprised at the difficulty of implementing effective keyboard-based element navigation. So I created [Dimension](https://github.com/a-type/dimension), a generalized keyboard selection library. It uses MutationObserver to track element positions so you can worry less about keeping callbacks and attributes in sync.

##### üåê Graphs

As part of my explorations into deeply connected data with my side-project [Toast](https://github.com/a-type/toast), I did a deep-dive into graph databases and the tools that surround them. What I found was opportunities for new tools.

- [graphql-arangodb](https://github.com/a-type/graphql-arangodb): An experimental query translation layer for ArangoDB-powered GraphQL APIs
- [üì¶ Archived] | [toast](https://github.com/a-type/toast): The (archived) side-project that started it all. PWA backed by serverless microservices.
- [üì¶ Archived] | [graphql-orientdb](https://github.com/a-type/graphql-orientdb): An (archvied) experimental query translation layer for OrientDB-powered GraphQL APIs
- [üì¶ Archived] | [graphql-cypher](https://github.com/a-type/graphql-cypher): An (archived) experimental replacement for [neo4j-graphql-js](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js), which began my interest in query translation layers for GraphQL and Graph DBs
- [üì¶ Archived] | [neo4j-migrate](https://github.com/a-type/neo4j-migrate): Another tool to fill a hole in Graph Database workflows, this migrates Neo4j data models
